# Hinglish-Translation
Description:
This code demonstrates a basic approach to generate mixed-language (Hinglish) text from English input sentences using a pre-trained translation model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. It aims to provide an example of how to combine English and Hinglish words alternately to create mixed-language output.


## Instructions:

# Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install the necessary libraries using the following command:
Copy code
pip install torch transformers


# Usage:

Modify the sentences list in the code to input your own English sentences.
Run the code to generate mixed-language output for the provided sentences.

# Output:
The code will display the input English sentences and their corresponding mixed-language (Hinglish) output.

# Important Notes:

This code provides a basic example of mixing English and Hinglish words alternately. The quality of the output may vary depending on the input and the translation model used.
Generating meaningful mixed-language text often requires more advanced techniques and fine-tuning on custom datasets.
Feel free to customize and improve this code for your specific needs or refer to more advanced approaches for generating high-quality mixed-language text.
